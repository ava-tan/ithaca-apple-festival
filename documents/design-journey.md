# Project 3 - Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.

## Planning, Design, & Evaluation

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your site's target audience? This should be the original target audience from Project 1 or Project 2.


### Planning & Designing for User Input (Milestone 1)
> Determine what purpose the form for your site will accomplish, where it will go (physical placement on page and the HTML file name), and what form components you plan on using.

Purpose:


Location:


Form Components:
  - Name: text field; `<input>`
  - Age: number field; `<input type="number">`
  - ...

> Include sketches on your form below. Include sketches of your **mobile and desktop** versions.

**Desktop Sketches**


**Mobile Sketches**


> What submission method will your form use? GET or POST. Explain your reasoning.


### Determine the Form Validation Criteria (Milestone 1)
> For each control in your form, specify the validation criteria AND your reasoning behind the criteria.

- e.g. Age
  - reasoning: Age is required because users must be over 21. Can't have negative ages. Oldest human was 122.
  - required/optional: `required` (or optional)
  - constraints: `min="0" max="125"`


### Design Form Feedback (Milestone 1)
> Include sketches of your **mobile and desktop** _feedback_.

**Desktop Feedback**


**Mobile Feedback**


### User Testing Plan (Milestone 1)
> Plan out your **one** task to evaluate your form.

Task:


### User 1 - Testing Notes (Milestone 1)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 1 (Milestone 1)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user 1 by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user 1, e.g., where user 1 comes from, what is your user 1’s job, characteristics, etc.?


2. Does your user 1 belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)

> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?


### User 1 - **Desktop** (Milestone 1)
> Report the results of your user 1 evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

- **Did you evaluate the desktop or mobile design?**
  - Pick one: desktop/mobile
- **How did the user do? Did they meet your expectation?**
  - TODO
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
  - TODO
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
  - TODO
- **Re-design choices**
  - TODO
- **Additional Notes**
  - TODO: Justify your decisions; additional notes.


### User 2 - Testing Notes (Milestone 1)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.


### User 2 (Milestone 1)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user 2 by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user 2, e.g., where user 2 comes from, what is your user 2’s job, characteristics, etc.?


2. Does your user 2 belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)

> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?


### User 2 - **Mobile** (Milestone 1)
> Report the results of your user 2 evaluation. You should explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.

### Design Changes (Final Submission)
> Use the space provided here to document any design changes from testing.


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!
